### TamperMonkey script to add download links to RetroAchievements.org's "Supported Game Files" pages

**Please respect RA.org's policies and do not post links to ROMs on their website or Discord.**

The script has a small delay, but if no download link appears after a few moments, you may need to source it manually as the file most likely does not exist in the hashlist.

### Versions:

There are 3 versions of the script to download (Only use one at a time):
- **Updated Script** - The hashlist is hosted on GitHub and can be quickly edited through pull requests.
- **Fixed Old Script** - Wholee's original script and hashlist hosted on Archive.org with changes by me to ensure it's compatible with the new RA web layout.
- **Original Wholee Script** - A broken script and hashlist hosted on Archive.org.

### Install:

- **Updated Script:** [TamperMonkeyRetroachievements.js](https://github.com/MentalBlank/RARomOnHashesUserScript/raw/refs/heads/main/TamperMonkeyRetroachievements.js)

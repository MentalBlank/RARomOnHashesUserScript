### Disclaimer:
- **Please respect RA.org's policies and do not post links to ROMs on their website or Discord.**
- **ROMs and Legality:** Users are encouraged to ensure they have the legal rights to any files they access through this script. Downloading ROMs without owning the original physical copy may violate copyright laws in your region. Always verify the legality of ROMs and other digital content before use.
- **Video Game Preservation:** This script is part of a broader effort to support video game preservation. The archiving of games is important to ensure that classic video games remain accessible and playable for future generations. However, it is important to always respect the rights of developers and publishers while engaging in such activities.

### Versions:

There are 3 versions of the script to download (Only use one at a time):
- **Updated Script** - The hashlist is hosted on GitHub and can be quickly edited through pull requests.
- **Fixed Old Script** - Wholee's original script and hashlist hosted on Archive.org with changes by me to ensure it's compatible with the new RA web layout.
- **Original Wholee Script** - A broken script and hashlist hosted on Archive.org.

### Notes:
- The updated and fixed scripts have a small delay, but if no download link appears after a few moments refresh the page, or source it manually as the file most likely does not exist in hashlinks.json / the archive.org source.
- RA occasionally "recycles" game id's for various reasons including not meeting standards, this can lead to incorrect links appearing under some hashes as these were previously linked roms. If this happens please report it via bug report or modify it via pull request.
